# First web development project
## Beginning with a Simple Tic-Tac-Toe Game
I have created a basic tictactoe game website trying various css styles, integrating the javascript for handling everything from click actions to replay option. Also, I have successfully managed to host it using netlify.<br>You can view the website with the link below :<br>https://66c1d6eecef61000082bf45d--moonlit-crumble-c3d20a.netlify.app/ <br><br>Thanks for having your precious time here..!
